This repo was moved from devops to its own repo because it sort of grew in use and importance. 

Spam Training for SpamAssassin
================

System setup to receive spam candidates from users into a special mailbox. And then notify admins who can confirm or delete the candidates. Confirmed candidates are placed in a special directory for later sa-learning. 

Please go through settings.py before attempting science. 

Tools
====

In the tools dir is what I use to run sa-learn, along with incrond. I wrote it in Python only to use the settings.py file, all it does is run the sa-learn program on the two ham and spam directories. 

HOWTO Sendmail
===========

It's supposed to receive e-mail from an alias in /etc/aliases like this. 

    spamtraining: 	|/etc/smrsh/spamtraining

In sendmail this requires a symlink with the actual program from /etc/smrsh/spamtraining. The program should be owned by the mail user that executes it. 

HOWTO Postfix
==========

Has also been tested in postfix where the smrsh linking procedure is not required. 

Simply put it into /etc/aliases like this:

	spamtraining: |/usr/share/devops/spam/spamutbildning.py

And make sure the devops/spam dir is owned by the postfix user, nobody:nogroup on Debian. This is required to create directories inside the spam dir. 

Alternatively in Postfix you can use virtual aliases to setup a real host. 

	spamtraining@mydomain spamtraining

For example. 

TODO
====

  * Add logging handler for sending critical errors to admins
  * http://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.handlers.html#logging.handlers.SMTPHandler
	* Make admin commands more dynamic in a list or something
